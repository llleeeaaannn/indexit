To Do:
Frontend Styling

Write logic tp get holdings file from relevant website once a day (with backup if fail...)

Add logic to handle week days where market is closed. Most liley has to be error handling logic to prevent nothing goes wrong when market closed.

Add logic to handle API calls where the symbol is not recognised (for example:  symbol: 'CASH_USD')

Add handling on backend when storing data to handle proeprties not being there on data returned from API call (no price, no percent, cant find symbol...)
