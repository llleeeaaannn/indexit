To Do:
Searchbar not functioning correctly. Issues:
- First entered character returns correct stocks
- After that thr result doesnt match (Shows wrong stocks and not even right stocks)

Add method to remove all stock components when searchbar goes from populated to empty

Try displaying all stocks and then narrowing based on search

Refactor search logic

Ensure changes arent lost when stock compoenents are changed then rerendered after search

Comment code

Add ability to change price of stock with exact values for both dollars & percentage

Make sliders less laggy

Figure out how to get updated prices for each component despite api limits:
- Make calls every 15 minutes from the backend
- Use different API's
- Find an API with no limit
