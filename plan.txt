To Do:
Figure out how to calculate ETf price following changes in stock prices

Frontend Styling (spacing is weird on stock components)

Style searchbar and message when there's no matches

Add percent and dollar signs to input value change fields in stock component

Write logic to get holdings file from relevant website once a day (with backup if fail...) -> Backup should be keeping the current holdings file

Add logic to handle week days where market is closed. Most liley has to be error handling logic to prevent nothing goes wrong when market closed.
-> Above logic to keep current holdings file if none other is available.
-> Logic for API calls potentially returning errors or values with large bid asks

Add logic to call SPY price very often
-> Either on page load from frontend
-> Or backend calls it at set intervals

Add logic to handle API calls where the symbol is not recognised (for example:  symbol: 'CASH_USD')

Add handling on backend when storing data to handle proeprties not being there on data returned from API call (no price, no percent, cant find symbol...)

Functionality:
Users can adjust price of a ticker and index price will update.
Users can adjust by $ or % amount and index will be shown in $ and %.
Users can adjust using a slider or enter the amount of change in a text box.
Users can adjust multiple stocks at once.
Users can adjust entire sectors/industries by % (not price)
Users can reset all changes with a button
Users can reset single stock changes with a button
Not all stocks will display to improve performance
Users will have the ability to display more stocks

UI:
Each stock is own component
Each stock is a row
By default ordered from highest % to lowest
Open to change sorting (hight %, lowest %, alphabetical, biggest change, lowest change)
Search bar which removes all stocks that dont match
At top: component for index which shows actual price, adjusted price, difference (in $ and %)
Navbar at top with list of all available indices
